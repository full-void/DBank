=======
Every other sector is switching from conventional system working to decentralised and distributed system. The only organisations that lack behind are the exchanges and the banks. So, the idea is to make a complete decentralised bank on ethereum. It would ensure a complete trustworthy system. There would be no need to trust even the banks.

## Implementation

The bank completely behaves as a conventional bank.It is fully decentralised without human intervention. The bank is implemented using a smart contract. Once deployed, the contract will be able to store ether. The users will be present at various nodes and possess the capabilities of depositing ether, requesting ether, crediting ether, p2p transaction.

## Debit System

The user with the address can deposit and request ether from the bank.

## Credit System

Each user's account possess a credit limit, credit score and credit balance. The user can request credit within the range of 
(credit limit - current credit). Each time users delays the payment of depositing back the ether, the user will be fined with 
1 extra ETHER monthly.
